# Title: Welcome to the era of big psychology
# Abstract:
Replication concerns in psychology have sparked a new era of massive, crowdsourced projects, and incidentally created large datasets for data-hungry techniques like machine learning. This presentation will discuss initiatives such as the Many Labs projects and the Psychological Science Accelerator which aim to bring hundreds of labs around the world together to answer questions no single lab could address alone. It will also discuss recent developments to use machine learning to help address this crisis, either through specific new analyses, greater emphasis on prediction and cross-validation, and a recent large-scale effort that aims to assess the credibility of claims in social science using machine learning.

"Machine learning: Applications to clinical and psychological research" 

The goal of this workshop is to explore opportunities, challenges and implications of applying machine learning (ML) principles and techniques to psychological and clinical research. To this aim we bring together talks of senior researchers and PhD students from different backgrounds (e.g. psychology, autism research, computer science, replication studies in psychology, etc.), but sharing a common interest in using ML to frame and address relevant research questions.
